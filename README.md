## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently a full-time compiler engineer and am also working on computability/complexity theory as a hobby,
  so I may not have enough time to keep an eye on my GitHub account.
- Because now everyone is talking about AI, I also want to share that I'm familiar with "compiler for AI"
  whose goal is accelerating AI models on special hardware platforms.
- I'll only keep maintaining the pinned projects, but I may add other pinned projects later.
