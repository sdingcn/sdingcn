## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a compiler engineer and am also working on computability/complexity theory as a hobby.
- Because now everyone is talking about AI: I'm familiar with "compiler for AI"
  whose goal is accelerating AI models on special hardware platforms.
- I'll only keep maintaining the pinned projects.
